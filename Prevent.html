    <div class="Prevent-intro">
        <h2>To avoid environmental damage from improper waste disposal, it is essential to dispose of waste correctly. This includes recycling as much waste as possible, using composting to dispose of organic waste, and using appropriate containers for hazardous waste. It is also crucial to dispose of waste at designated sites rather than dumping it illegally or hiring dumpster rental services to dispose of your waste safely.</h2>

        <p>It reduces the need to extract raw materials from the earth, which can have negative environmental impacts like deforestation, soil erosion, and habitat destruction. Moreover, recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Proper composting of the organic waste we generate in our daily lives – inedible or unused food – can reduce the dependence on chemical fertilizers, help recover soil fertility, and improve water retention and the delivery of nutrients to plants.</p>

        <h1>PRACTICE WASTE SEGREGATION</h1>
        <div class="Prevent-frame">
            <img src="Practice Waste Segregation.avif" alt="" id="Prevent-Image">
        </div>
        <p>By segregating waste, we can reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfill and recycle more materials. There are many types of waste, and each type should be segregated into its bin.</p>
