            <p>Gastrointestinal infections are a common global health problem, often affecting the stomach or intestines
                and
                typically resulting in diarrhea. Most cases resolve without treatment after a few days. However, in
                select
                populations, diarrheal diseases can carry a high degree of morbidity and mortality.</p>

            <p>Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable
                and
                recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms. Symptoms include

            <p>Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. It is usually caused by bacteria,
                viruses,
                or parasites that are present in the food. The symptoms of food poisoning can vary depending on the type
                of
                contaminant and the individualâ€™s immune system.</p>

            <p>Vector-borne diseases are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses, and bacteria that are transmitted
                by
                vectors. These vectors can be mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, or other insects that feed on human blood or
                other
                substances. Vector-borne diseases are a significant public health concern, as they can cause serious
                illness, disability, and even death.</p>
