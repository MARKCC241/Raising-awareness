    <div class="Home-intro">
        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Through education and advocacy, we can empower people to adopt responsible waste management practices,
            such as reducing, reusing, and recycling waste materials. By taking small yet meaningful actions in our
            daily lives, such as properly disposing of trash, reducing single-use plastics, and participating in
            clean-up efforts, we can collectively make a significant difference in preserving our environment for
            future generations.Together, let's raise awareness and take action to address improper waste disposal and
            build a cleaner,
            healthier, and more sustainable world for all.</h2>
